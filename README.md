# Computing Project 2013 - The study of satellite orbiting Mars#

##Overview of the project:##

The aim of this project is to study the orbiting of a satellite around Mars and its energy changes. The motion of Mars is simulated to observe the changes in the motion of satellite. The motion of the satellite was simulated under different initial conditions to achieve different results. The main physics theorems used here were Newton's Gravitational Laws and Keplers' law.
